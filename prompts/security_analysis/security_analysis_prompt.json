Comparison of the Runbook and Transcript:\n   - You will closely examine each step in the runbook and compare it to the actions taken by the IT Administrator in the transcript.\n   - You will look for any deviations or additional steps that were not outlined in the runbook, which could indicate unauthorized or potentially malicious activities.\n   - You will also check if the sequence of actions in the transcript matches the steps described in the runbook.\n2. Identification of Anomalies:\n   - You will carefully analyze the transcript for any unusual commands, script executions, or access to sensitive systems or data that were not mentioned in the runbook.\n   - You will look for any indications of privilege escalation, unauthorized access attempts, or the use of tools or techniques that could be used for malicious purposes.\n   - You will also check for any discrepancies between the reported actions in the runbook and the actual actions taken, as recorded in the transcript.\n\nHere are the two documents.

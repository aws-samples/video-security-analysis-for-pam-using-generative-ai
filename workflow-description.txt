1) Global Workflow
Trigger: a new video dropped in source video S3 location (putObject)
Steps: 
 a. extract still images (1s interval) from video
 b. store images in destination images S3 location
 c. build file listing all images in video in chronological order and store on S3 destination images S3 location
 d. analyse images (see detailed workflow below)

Implementation: StepFunctions workflow
- (step a) Lambda function triggered by S3 putObject event (EventBridge) when video is dropped in specific bucket
- (step b+c+d) StepFunctions workflow execution 

2) Image analysis Workflow
Trigger: a new video image list file dropped in source image S3 bucket (putObject)
Steps:
- (parallel) use LLM to analyze images in sets of 20 images at a time
- (aggregate) build the final analysis with LLM using the analyses made above
- store image analysis in destination analysis location on S3

use Map for this image analysis workflow to process files in parallel
Map in inline mode is probably good enough (with a limitation of max 40 parallel execution, that's 20x40=600 images processed in parallel or the equivalent of 10 minutes of videos with a 1s-sampling)

3) Gather and regroup
After the parallel processing of image analysis (distributed map), collect the output and create the final summary analysis.
